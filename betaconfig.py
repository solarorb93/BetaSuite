#### Neural Net input size.  This controls how the net views the image.
#### Different values may be best for different photos.
#### 
#### [ 1280 ]: recommended, good performance and speed tradeoff
#### [ 640 ]:  much faster, decent performance when model fills the frame
#### [ 2560 ]: slower, better for collage or big group photos.  
#### 
#### [ 1280, 2560 ]: combine the two, may be safer than either alone
####
#### [ 0 ]: not recommended, uses photos as-is to neural net.

#### BetaTV does not run the neural net on every single frame of a
#### video.  Instead, it runs a few times per second, and then 
#### uses those to censor the whole video.  Set the neural net
#### runs per second here.  More means better accuracy, but slower.
#### 5 is a good sweet spot.  You can drop to 3 if 5 is too slow,
#### but you should probably increase the time_safety values
#### in the censoring config if you do.  15 is what I use for
#### best accuracy.

#default_censor_style = [ 'pixel', 40 ] # second item is the how much to pixelate.  Higher is more censored.  10 means that a 200x400 pixel region is pixelated to 20x40 pixels.

# min_prob: how confident are we that the item is identified before blocking
default_min_prob = 0.60 #0.50 means 50% certainty

# Input Delete Probability
#### If you set this to 1, all uncensored files
#### will be deleted after censoring.  If you set
#### this to a number between 0 and 1, there will 
#### be a random chance of the input being deleted.
#### For example, if you set it to 0.7, for each
#### uncensored file, there is a 70% chance it will
#### be deleted.
#### I ***HIGHLY*** recommend testing censoring
#### with this set to zero first.  Using this 
#### setting is dangerous.  BetaSuite will try 
#### to verify that the file was successfully 
#### censored before deleting, but if there is
#### some issue with the image or video writing
#### process, BetaSuite might not know.
#### SET THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
#### DON'T COME CRYING IF YOUR FILE WAS DELETED
